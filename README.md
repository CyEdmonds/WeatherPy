### Analysis

* Unsurprisingly, max temperatures increase as location moves towards the equator (0 latitude). Cities in the southern hemisphere (negative latitude) show higher max temperatures at this time of year than those in the northern hemisphere due to the Earth's tilt, making it winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere at this date.

* There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. I found it interesting to note obvious banding of cities at 0%, 20%, and ~80% cloudiness. Other, less obvious bands seem apparent as well, suggesting there may be some "human" factor or other less scientifically accurate measure of recording cloudiness data.

* There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. Most cities tend to be located in areas with wind speeds under 10 mph. One remarkable outlier reports wind speeds in excess of 35 mph.

* There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity. This data might have revealed more insights if we tracking data with more dynamic variation, such as movements of air masses, rather than just simple north/south (latitude) measures.

* The data also reflects the distribution of available land mass (though indirectly) by showing more cities located above 60 degrees latitude (northern hemisphere) and no cities (in this sample) below -60 degrees latitude. This is unsurprising given that there is little landmass other than Antartica below -60 degrees.
